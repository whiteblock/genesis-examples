# Minimal Prysm Eth2.0 Testnet
This example will run a eth2.0 prysm testnet consisting of a single beacon-chain client and validator.
This example uses a mocked eth1 chain instead of goerli and
a minimal config that only requires 64 validator deposits for the beacon chain to start

# NOTE:
You need to clone this repo recursively to build the validator and beacon chain images
